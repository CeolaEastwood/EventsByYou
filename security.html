      <h3>Data Security 101</h3><br><br>
      <p class="sec">Here at events by you we strive to keep your information safe.
        Did you know that your computer can send information about the browser,
        operating system, compatibility issues,
        and if you have a good internet connection?
        It’s also possible to get information about the monitor such as the
        height, width, color depth, and pixels.
      </p><br>
      <p class="sec">However, one of the best things you can do is change your passwords.
        While experts disagree on the frequency, you should always reset passwords as
        soon as you think your account is compromised.

        <p class="sec">Something most people don’t think about is public wi-fi.
          The more of them you connect with the higher the chance of your
          information will the stolen. Take advantage of the new security features on
          Chrome and when in doubt, try to use a data plan. More info
